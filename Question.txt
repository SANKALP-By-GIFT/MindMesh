Difficulty Level: Medium → Moderate Advanced (MCA Level)
Backend: ❌ Not Allowed (Frontend Only with Mock Data / Local Simulation)

📌 Problem Statement

Design and implement a Group Expense Splitter Application using React.

The application must allow users to:

Add shared expenses

Split expenses among multiple group members

Automatically calculate balances

Display who owes whom

Manage global state properly

Persist data locally

Apply performance optimization

Implement reusable calculation logic via custom hooks

This project evaluates:

Algorithmic thinking

Context-based state management

Derived state calculation

Performance optimization

Clean component architecture

🎯 SECTION A — CORE REQUIREMENTS (70 Marks)
1️⃣ Group Setup & Dashboard (10 Marks)
Functional Requirements

Create a dashboard route:

/dashboard


Display:

Total expenses

Total paid per user

Net balances

Allow creation of group members (minimum 3 required).

Each member must have:

Name

Unique ID

2️⃣ Add Expense Feature (20 Marks)
Functional Requirements

User must be able to:

Add new expense

Select payer (who paid)

Enter amount

Select participants involved

Add optional description

Add date

Example:

Ravi paid ₹600 for dinner shared between Ravi, Aman, and Priya.

Technical Requirements

Use React Hook Form

Validate:

Amount > 0

At least 1 participant selected

Store expense in global state (Context)

3️⃣ Split Calculation Logic (20 Marks)

You must implement logic to:

Split expense equally among selected participants

Calculate:

How much each person owes

Net balance per user

Who should pay whom

Example Output:

Aman owes Ravi ₹200
Priya owes Ravi ₹200

Important:

Do NOT hardcode values.

Calculation must update dynamically whenever:

New expense added

Expense edited

Expense deleted

4️⃣ Balance Summary View (10 Marks)

Display:

List of all users

Total paid

Total owed

Net balance:

Positive → To receive

Negative → To pay

Highlight:

Positive balances (green)

Negative balances (red)

5️⃣ Context-Based State Management (10 Marks)

You must create:

ExpenseContext

useExpenses() custom hook

Context must manage:

Members list

Expenses list

Add / Edit / Delete expense functions

Explain in comments:

Why Context is sufficient

When Redux would be more appropriate

6️⃣ Custom Calculation Hook (10 Marks)

Create a reusable hook:

useBalanceCalculator()


This hook must:

Accept expenses + members

Return:

Per-user totals

Net balances

Settlement summary

Logic must NOT remain inside component.

Separation of logic = higher marks.
